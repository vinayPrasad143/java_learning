OOPs concept
Object oriented program is the methodology to design a program using classes and objects.

object
An object is a real world entity such as pen, chair, paper etc...
Any entity that has state and behaviour is known as Object. It can be a logical or physical.

An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. It contains an address and takes up some space in memory.
Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code.

Example: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc.
as well as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.

Class
Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.

A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class does not consume any space.
